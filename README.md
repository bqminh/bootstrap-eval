# Intepreting bootstrap supports for phylogenetics

## Motivation

This project aims to evaluate the intepretation of support values generated by Felsenstein's bootstrap (FBP), transfer bootstrap expectation (TBE) and other bootstrap methods. To do so we rely on simulations where the true trees are known. The main idea is to look at the correlation between branch supports inferred by each method and the probability that the branch is true. While FBP is well known to be conservative (i.e., FBP support of >=70% typically means that the branch is true with a probability of >=0.95), none is known about TBE. Thus, we want to assess if the suggested threshold of 70% applies well to TBE or not.


## Simulations

### PANDIT simulations

We downloaded the simulated DNA alignments based on the PANDIT database from

### Birth-death simulations

1. Run generate_datasets.R (this relies on the functions.R script). This generates datasets and runs IQ-TREE on them.

2. Run calculate_tbes.R (this uses booster to calculate TBE and FBP for each dataset)

3. Run bootstrap_data.R (this generates the output file simulated.csv)

4. Run bootstrap_plots.R (this combines the output from your analysis (pandit.csv) with the output from mine (simulated.csv) and makes the plot in the paper)

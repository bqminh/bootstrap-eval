# Folder for simulated alignments under the birth-death process.


* Sub-folders 1 to 2500 are for 20-tip trees
* Sub-folders 2501 to 3000 are 100-tip trees.
* Sub-folders 3001 to 3100 are 500-tip trees.

Each sub-folder contains the following files:

* `chronogram.phy`: ultrametric tree generated under birth-death process
* `phylogram.phy`: phylogenetic tree used to simulate alignment.
* `alignment.fasta`: simulated alignment
* Output files by IQ-TREE:
    - `alignment.fasta.bionj`: BIONJ tree
    - `alignment.fasta.boottrees`: All bootstrap trees
    - `alignment.fasta.ckp.gz`: Checkpoint file
    - `alignment.fasta.contree`: Consensus tree
    - `alignment.fasta.iqtree`: Report file
    - `alignment.fasta.log`: Log file
    - `alignment.fasta.mldist`: Pairwise distance matrix
    - `alignment.fasta.treefile`: Best maximum-likelihood tree found
* `alignment.fasta.fbptree`: Tree generated by Booster with support values by Felsenstein's bootstrap proportion (FBP) 
* `alignment.fasta.tbetree`: Tree generated by Booster with support values by transfer bootstrap expectation (TBE)
